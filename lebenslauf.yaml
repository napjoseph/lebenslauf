            description: "I worked with hundreds of developers across multiple countries to improve Oracle's Higher Education Student Cloud information system. I developed new frontend features using Oracle JavaScript Extension Toolkit (JET), and new backend features using Oracle Application Development Framework (ADF). As part of the requirements, I ensured all our repositories had at least 90% code coverage by writing unit tests using Mocha, Chai.js, and Sinon.JS. I also guaranteed that our features met all acceptance criteria in the specifications by creating functional tests using Selenium. Lastly, to reduce technical debt, I also migrated legacy vanilla JavaScript modules to use TypeScript."

            description: "I worked as a vendor at Google, creating and maintaining business-critical Network Operations Center dashboards and tools using Python, Go, Angular, TypeScript, Google Cloud Platform, gRPC, Protocol Buffers, and other internal technologies. I also analyzed large data sets from Cloud SQL, Bigtable, and BigQuery and created interactive dashboards using Data Studio and PLX Dashboard. After only three months, I earned an internal Go and TypeScript Readability certification to attest that a developer understands Google's best practices and coding style for a given language, given to only a select few in the Philippines. I worked closely with stakeholders and the technical project manager to ensure project deadlines and proposed different Project Requirements Documents (PRD) for new project initiatives."

            description: "I was hired as a database consultant to help split, hand over, and dispose of the telecommunications network assets to PLDT and Globe Telecom. As the existing database was in the form of multiple spreadsheet files with no unified format, I led a team of analysts to consolidate, normalize, de-duplicate, clean, and verify entries. To ensure data accuracy, I developed an internal web application using Python and Django to improve the current manual data entry and verification process. Lastly, I also worked with external project managers by generating daily reports and presentations to check the overall status of the operation."
